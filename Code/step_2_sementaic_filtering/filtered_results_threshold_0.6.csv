transmission dynamics informed neural network with application to covid19 infections,since the end of 2019 the covid19 repeatedly surges with most countriesterritories experiencing multiple waves and mechanismbased epidemic models played important roles in understanding the transmission mechanism of multiple epidemic waves however capturing temporal changes of the transmissibility of covid19 during the multiple waves keeps illposed problem for traditional mechanismbased epidemic compartment models because that the transmission rate is usually assumed to be specific piecewise functions and more parameters are added to the model once multiple epidemic waves involved which poses a huge challenge to parameter estimation meanwhile datadriven deep neural networks fail to discover the driving factors of repeated outbreaks and lack interpretability in this study aiming at developing a datadriven method to project timedependent parameters but also merging the advantage of mechanismbased models we propose a transmission dynamics informed neural network tdinn by encoding the seird compartment model into deep neural networks we show that the proposed tdinn algorithm performs very well when fitting the covid19 epidemic data with multiple waves where the epidemics in the united states italy south africa and kenya and several outbreaks the omicron variant in china are taken as examples in addition the numerical simulation shows that the trained tdinn can also perform as a predictive model to capture the future development of covid19 epidemic we find that the transmission rate inferred by the tdinn frequently fluctuates and a feedback loop between the epidemic shifting and the changes of transmissibility drives the occurrence of multiple waves we observe a long response delay to the implementation of control interventions in the four countries while the decline of the transmission rate in the outbreaks in china usually happens once the implementation of control interventions the further simulation show that 17 days delay of the response to the implementation of control interventions lead to a roughly fourfold increase in daily reported cases in one epidemic wave in italy which suggest that a rapid response to policies that strengthen control interventions can be effective in flattening the epidemic curve or avoiding subsequent epidemic waves we observe that the transmission rate in the outbreaks in china is already decreasing before enhancing control interventions providing the evidence that the increasing of the epidemics can drive selfconscious behavioural changes to protect against infections,,37696183,0.6382616758346558

linear and nonlinear dynamics of the epidemics system identification based parametric prediction models for the pandemic outbreaks,coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 has endured constituting formidable economic social educational and phycological challenges for the societies moreover during pandemic outbreaks the hospitals are overwhelmed with patients requiring more intensive care units and intubation equipment therein to cope with these urgent healthcare demands the state authorities seek ways to develop policies based on the estimated future casualties these policies are mainly nonpharmacological policies including the restrictions curfews closures and lockdowns in this paper we construct three model structures of the spinitibdn suspicious sp infected in intensive care it intubated ib and dead d together with the nonpharmacological policies n holding two key targets the first one is to predict the future covid19 casualties including the intensive care and intubated ones which directly determine the need for urgent healthcare facilities and the second one is to analyse the linear and nonlinear dynamics of the covid19 pandemic under the nonpharmacological policies in this respect we have modified the nonpharmacological policies and incorporated them within the models whose parameters are learned from the available data the trained models with the data released by the turkish health ministry confirmed that the linear spinitibdn model yields more accurate results under the imposed nonpharmacological policies it is important to note that the nonpharmacological policies have a damping effect on the pandemic casualties and this can dominate the nonlinear dynamics herein a model without pharmacological or nonpharmacological policies might have more dominant nonlinear dynamics in addition the paper considers two machine learning approaches to optimize the unknown parameters of the constructed models the results show that the recursive neural network has superior performance for learning nonlinear dynamics however the batch least squares outperforms in the presence of linear dynamics and stochastic data the estimated future pandemic casualties with the linear spinitibdn model confirm that the suspicious infected and dead casualties converge to zero from 200000 1400 200 casualties respectively the convergences occur in 120 days under the current conditions,PMC8349905,34412892,0.617095947265625
improving prediction of covid19 evolution by fusing epidemiological and mobility data,we are witnessing the dramatic consequences of the covid19 pandemic which unfortunately go beyond the impact on the health system until herd immunity is achieved with vaccines the only available mechanisms for controlling the pandemic are quarantines perimeter closures and social distancing with the aim of reducing mobility governments only apply these measures for a reduced period since they involve the closure of economic activities such as tourism cultural activities or nightlife the main criterion for establishing these measures and planning socioeconomic subsidies is the evolution of infections however the collapse of the health system and the unpredictability of human behavior among others make it difficult to predict this evolution in the short to medium term this article evaluates different models for the early prediction of the evolution of the covid19 pandemic to create a decision support system for policymakers we consider a wide branch of models including artificial neural networks such as lstm and gru and statistically based models such as autoregressive ar or arima moreover several consensus strategies to ensemble all models into one system are proposed to obtain better results in this uncertain environment finally a multivariate model that includes mobility data provided by google is proposed to better forecast trend changes in the 14day ci a real case study in spain is evaluated providing very accurate results for the prediction of 14day ci in scenarios with and without trend changes reaching 093 formula see text 416 rmse and 108 mae,PMC8313557,34312455,0.6326627135276794

on cognitive epidemic models spatial segregation versus nonpharmaceutical interventions,ficks law and the fokkerplanck law of diffusion are applied to manifest the cognitive dispersal of individuals in two reactiondiffusion seir epidemic models where the disease transmission is illustrated by nonlocal infection mechanisms in heterogeneous environments building upon the wellposedness of solutions threshold dynamics are discussed in terms of the basic reproduction numbers for the two cognitive epidemic models the numerical investigation reveals that the fokkerplanck law can better describe the diffusion of individuals by taking different dispersal strategies of exposed individuals in our cognitive epidemic models and provides some insights on spatial segregation and nonpharmaceutical interventions i spatial segregation occurs in the random diffusion model when the nonlocal infection radius is small while it appears in the symmetric diffusion model when the radius is large ii nonpharmaceutical interventions on restricting the dispersal of exposed and infected individuals do not contribute to reducing the infection proportion but rather eliminate the disease in a region which expands as the nonlocal infection radius increases we additionally find that the final infection size in the random diffusion model is significantly smaller than that in the symmetric diffusion model and decreases as the nonlocal infection radius increases,,38407605,0.6448936462402344
