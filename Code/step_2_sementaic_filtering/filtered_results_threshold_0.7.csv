outbreakflow modelbased bayesian inference of disease outbreak dynamics with invertible neural networks and its application to the covid19 pandemics in germany,mathematical models in epidemiology are an indispensable tool to determine the dynamics and important characteristics of infectious diseases apart from their scientific merit these models are often used to inform political decisions and interventional measures during an ongoing outbreak however reliably inferring the epidemical dynamics by connecting complex models to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual parameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated from scratch for every application of a given model in this work we address this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with specialized neural networks our approach entails two computational phases in an initial training phase a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used as a coach for a neural network which acquires global knowledge about the full range of possible disease dynamics in the subsequent inference phase the trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and infers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the observed dynamics and reliably predict future progression with its flexible framework our simulationbased approach is applicable to a variety of epidemiological models moreover since our method is fully bayesian it is designed to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter values and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these parameters application of our method to the early covid19 outbreak phase in germany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic estimates for important disease characteristics such as generation time fraction of undetected infections likelihood of transmission before symptom onset and reporting delays using a very moderate amount of realworld observations,PMC8584772,34695111,0.7023816704750061

nearterm forecasts of influenzalike illness an evaluation of autoregressive time series approaches,seasonal influenza in the united states is estimated to cause 935 million illnesses annually with resultant economic burden amounting to 47150 billion reliable realtime forecasts of influenza can help public health agencies better manage these outbreaks here we investigate the feasibility of three autoregressive methods for nearterm forecasts an autoregressive integrated moving average arima model with timevarying order an arima model fit to seasonally adjusted incidence rates arimastl and a feedforward autoregressive artificial neural network with a single hidden layer arnn we generated retrospective forecasts for influenza incidence one to four weeks in the future at us national and 10 regions in the us during 5 influenza seasons we compared the relative accuracy of the point and probabilistic forecasts of the three models with respect to each other and in relation to two large external validation sets that each comprise at least 20 other models both the probabilistic and point forecasts of arnn were found to be more accurate than those of the other two models overall an additional subanalysis found that the three models benefitted considerably from the use of search trends based nowcast as a proxy for surveillance data and these three models with use of nowcasts were found to be the highest ranked models in both validation datasets when the nowcasts were withheld the three models remained competitive relative to models in the validation sets the difference in accuracy among the three models and relative to models of the validation sets was found to be largely statistically significant our results suggest that autoregressive models even when not equipped to capture transmission dynamics can provide reasonably accurate nearterm forecasts for influenza existing support in opensource libraries make them suitable nonnaïve baselines for model comparison studies and for operational forecasts in resource constrained settings where more sophisticated methods may not be feasible,,30792135,0.7254034280776978
prediction of influenzalike illness based on the improved artificial tree algorithm and artificial neural network,because influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that seriously threatens public health accurate realtime prediction of influenza outbreaks may help save lives in this paper we use the twitter data set and the united states centers for disease controls influenzalike illness ili data set to predict a nearly realtime regional unweighted percentage ili in the united states by use of an artificial neural network optimized by the improved artificial tree algorithm the results show that the proposed method is an efficient approach to realtime prediction,PMC5861130,29559649,0.7009620666503906
a micropopulational modelling of a viral epidemic by using a special neural network,a general forward neural network was adapted for a simulation of viral epidemics this involves the introduction of a strongly dependence upon history upon the cumulated values of the corresponding neuron individual activations states of infection specifying the activation health states of the contaminated individuals represented by the activated neurons and the dynamic parameters of the neural network the matrix of the synaptic connection and the vector of the activation thresholds corresponding to the matrix of the viral transfers between the various individuals and to the vector of the minimal individual contamination doses of virus the recurrence relations and the learning procedures were also adapted to these processes this methodology was used for the study of the micropopulational spreading of viral epidemics in various epidemiological situations,,10724978,0.7003656625747681
spatialtemporal diffusion model of aggregated infectious diseases based on population life characteristics a case study of covid19,outbreaks of infectious diseases pose significant threats to human life and countries around the world need to implement more precise prevention and control measures to contain the spread of viruses in this study we propose a spatialtemporal diffusion model of infectious diseases under a discrete grid based on the time series prediction of infectious diseases to model the diffusion process of viruses in population this model uses the estimated outbreak origin as the center of transmission employing a treelike structure of daily human travel to generalize the process of viral spread within the population by incorporating diverse data it simulates the congregation of people thus quantifying the flow weights between grids for population movement the model is validated with some chinese cities with covid19 outbreaks and the results show that the outbreak point estimation method could better estimate the virus transmission center of the epidemic the estimated location of the outbreak point in xian was only 0965 km different from the actual one and the results were more satisfactory the spatiotemporal diffusion model for infectious diseases simulates daily newly infected areas which effectively cover the actual patient infection zones on the same day during the midstage of viral transmission the coverage rate can increase to over 90 compared to related research this method has improved simulation accuracy by approximately 18 this study can provide technical support for epidemic prevention and control and assist decisionmakers in developing more scientific and efficient epidemic prevention and control policies,,37501479,0.7003217935562134
