phage susceptibility testing and infectious titer determination through widefield lensless monitoring of phage plaque growth,the growing number of drugresistant bacterial infections worldwide is driving renewed interest in phage therapy based on the use of a personalized cocktail composed of highly specific bacterial viruses this therapy relies on a range of tests on agar media to determine the most active phage on a given bacterial target phage susceptibility testing or to isolate new lytic phages from an environmental sample enrichment of phage banks however these culturebased techniques are still solely interpreted through direct visual detection of plaques the main objective of this work is to investigate computerassisted methods in order to ease and accelerate diagnosis in phage therapy but also to study phage plaque growth kinetics for this purpose we designed a custom widefield lensless imaging device which allows continuous monitoring over a very large area sensor 33 cm2 here we report bacterial susceptibility to staphylococcus aureus phage in 3 hr and estimation of infectious titer in 8 hr 20 min these are much shorter timetoresults than the 12 to 24 hours traditionally needed since naked eye observation and counting of phage plaques is still the most widely used technique for susceptibility testing prior to phage therapy moreover the continuous monitoring of the samples enables the study of plaque growth kinetics which enables a deeper understanding of the interaction between phage and bacteria finally thanks to the 43 μm resolution we detect phageresistant bacterial microcolonies of klebsiella pneumoniae inside the boundaries of phage plaques and thus show that our prototype is also a suitable device to track phage resistance lensless imaging is therefore an allinone method that could easily be implemented in costeffective and compact devices in phage laboratories to help with phage therapy diagnosis,PMC7987195,33755710,0.575610876083374

live cell analysis and mathematical modeling identify determinants of attenuation of dengue virus 2omethylation mutant,dengue virus denv is the most common mosquitotransmitted virus infecting 390 million people worldwide in spite of this high medical relevance neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available denv elicits a strong interferon ifn response in infected cells but at the same time actively counteracts ifn production and signaling although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how denv spreads in ifncompetent cell systems to dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level we generated a fully viable reporter denv and host cells with authentic reporters for ifnstimulated antiviral genes we find that ifn controls denv infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic even at highdose ifn does not fully protect all cells in the culture and therefore viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of naïve cells by ifn by contrast a vaccine candidate denv mutant which lacks 2omethylation of viral rna is profoundly attenuated in ifncompetent cells through mathematical modeling of timeresolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of ifn production this rapid induction triggered by mutant denv precedes establishment of ifnresistance in infected cells thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate in contrast accelerated protection of naïve cells by paracrine ifn action has negligible impact in conclusion these results show that attenuation of the 2omethylation denv mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine ifn action on infected cells,PMC4697809,26720415,0.5172207355499268

a novel approach for covid19 infection forecasting based on multisource deep transfer learning,covid19 is a contagious disease so predicting its future infections in a provincial region requires the consideration of the related data ie rates of infection mortality and recovery etc over a period of time clearly the covid19 data of a particular provincial region can be easily modelled as a timeseries however predicting the future covid19 infections in a particular region is quite challenging when the availability of covid19 dataset of the province is of little quantity accordingly ml models when deployed for such tasks usually results in low infection prediction accuracy to overcome such issues of low variance and high bias in a model due to data scarcity multisource transfer learning mstl along with deep learning may be quite useful and effective therefore this paper proposes a novel technique based on multisource deep transfer learning msdtl to efficiently forecast the future covid19 infections in the provinces with insufficient covid19 data the proposed approach is a novel contribution as it considers the fact that future covid19 transmission in a region also depends on its population density and economic conditions gdp for accurate forecasting of the infections to tackle the pandemic efficiently the importance of this feature selection is experimentally proved in this paper our proposed approach employs the wellknown recurrent neural network architecture the longshort term memory lstm a popular deeplearning model for historydependent tasks a comparative analysis has been performed with existing stateofart algorithms to portray the efficiency of lstm thus formation of msdtl approach enhances the predictive precision capability of the lstm we evaluate the proposed methodology over the covid19 dataset from sixtytwo provinces belonging to different nations we then empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using two different evaluation metrics viz the mean absolute percentage error and the coefficient of determination we show that our proposed msdtl based approach is better in terms of the accuracy of the future infection prediction and produces improvements up to 96 over its withouttl counterpart,PMC9354391,36063688,0.6049580574035645

inverse design of viral infectivityenhancing peptide fibrils from continuous proteinvector embeddings,amyloidlike nanofibers from selfassembling peptides can promote viral gene transfer for therapeutic applications traditionally new sequences are discovered either from screening large libraries or by creating derivatives of known active peptides however the discovery of de novo peptides which are sequencewise not related to any known active peptides is limited by the difficulty to rationally predict structureactivity relationships because their activities typically have multiscale and multiparameter dependencies here we used a small library of 163 peptides as a training set to predict de novo sequences for viral infectivity enhancement using a machine learning ml approach based on natural language processing specifically we trained an ml model using continuous vector representations of the peptides which were previously shown to retain relevant information embedded in the sequences we used the trained ml model to sample the sequence space of peptides with 6 amino acids to identify promising candidates these 6mers were then further screened for charge and aggregation propensity the resulting 16 new 6mers were tested and found to be active with a 25 hit rate strikingly these de novo sequences are the shortest active peptides for infectivity enhancement reported so far and show no sequence relation to the training set moreover by screening the sequence space we discovered the first hydrophobic peptide fibrils with a moderately negative surface charge that can enhance infectivity hence this ml strategy is a time and costefficient way for expanding the sequence space of short functional selfassembling peptides exemplified for therapeutic viral gene delivery,,37341479,0.5631123781204224

signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has covid19,background covid19 illness is highly variable ranging from infection with no symptoms through to pneumonia and lifethreatening consequences symptoms such as fever cough or loss of sense of smell anosmia or taste ageusia can help flag early on if the disease is present such information could be used either to rule out covid19 disease or to identify people who need to go for covid19 diagnostic tests this is the second update of this review which was first published in 2020 objectives to assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings such as the emergency department or dedicated covid19 clinics has covid19 search methods we undertook electronic searches up to 10 june 2021 in the university of bern living search database in addition we checked repositories of covid19 publications we used artificial intelligence text analysis to conduct an initial classification of documents we did not apply any language restrictions selection criteria studies were eligible if they included people with clinically suspected covid19 or recruited known cases with covid19 and also controls without covid19 from a singlegate cohort studies were eligible when they recruited people presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings studies that included people who contracted sarscov2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible the minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants all signs and symptoms were eligible for this review including individual signs and symptoms or combinations we accepted a range of reference standards data collection and analysis pairs of review authors independently selected all studies at both title and abstract and fulltext stage they resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the quadas2 checklist and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author analyses were restricted to prospective studies only we presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots in receiver operating characteristic roc space and in dumbbell plots we estimated summary parameters using a

studies for this update we focused on the results of 42 prospective studies with 52608 participants prevalence of covid19 disease varied from 37 to 606 with a median of 274 thirtyfive studies were set in emergency departments or outpatient test centres 46878 participants three in primary care settings 1230 participants two in a mixed population of in and outpatients in a paediatric hospital setting 493 participants and two overlapping studies in nursing homes 4007 participants the studies did not clearly distinguish mild covid19 disease from covid19 pneumonia so we present the results for both conditions together twelve studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because they used a high level of preselection to decide whether reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rtpcr testing was needed or because they enrolled a nonconsecutive sample or because they excluded individuals while they were part of the study base we rated 36 of the 42 studies as high risk of bias for the index tests because there was little or no detail on how by whom and when the symptoms were measured for most studies eligibility for testing was dependent on the local case definition and testing criteria that were in effect at the time of the study meaning most people who were included in studies had already been referred to health services based on the symptoms that we are evaluating in this review the applicability of the results of this review iteration improved in comparison with the previous reviews this version has more studies of people presenting to ambulatory settings which is where the majority of assessments for covid19 take place only three studies presented any data on children separately and only one focused specifically on older adults we found data on 96 symptoms or combinations of signs and symptoms evidence on individual signs as diagnostic tests was rarely reported so this review reports mainly on the diagnostic value of symptoms results were highly variable across studies most had very low sensitivity and high specificity rtpcr was the most often used reference standard 4042 studies only cough 11 studies had a summary sensitivity above 50 624 95 ci 506 to 729 its specificity was low 454 95 ci 335 to 579 presence of fever had a sensitivity of 376 95 ci 234 to 543 and a specificity of 752 95 ci 563 to 878 the summary positive likelihood ratio of cough was 114 95 ci 104 to 125 and that of fever 152 95 ci 110 to 210 sore throat had a summary positive likelihood ratio of 0814 95 ci 0714 to 0929 which means that its presence increases the probability of having an infectious disease other than covid19 dyspnoea 12 studies and fatigue 8 studies had a sensitivity of 233 95 ci 164 to 319 and 402 95 ci 194 to 651 respectively their specificity was 757 95 ci 652 to 839 and 736 95 ci 484 to 893 the summary positive likelihood ratio of dyspnoea was 096 95 ci 083 to 111 and that of fatigue 152 95 ci 121 to 191 which means that the presence of fatigue slightly increases the probability of having covid19 anosmia alone 7 studies ageusia alone 5 studies and anosmia or ageusia 6 studies had summary sensitivities below 50 but summary specificities over 90 anosmia had a summary sensitivity of 264 95 ci 138 to 446 and a specificity of 942 95 ci 906 to 965 ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 232 95 ci 106 to 433 and a specificity of 926 95 ci 831 to 970 anosmia or ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 392 95 ci 265 to 536 and a specificity of 921 95 ci 845 to 962 the summary positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 455 95 ci 346 to 597 and 499 95 ci 322 to 775 respectively which is just below our arbitrary definition of a red flag that is a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5 the summary positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was 314 95 ci 179 to 551 twentyfour studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms mostly combining olfactory symptoms by combining symptoms with other information such as contact or travel history age gender and a local recent case detection rate some multivariable prediction scores reached a sensitivity as high as 90 authors conclusions most individual symptoms included in this review have poor diagnostic accuracy neither absence nor presence of symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out the disease the presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for the presence of covid19 the presence of cough also supports further testing there is currently no evidence to support further testing with pcr in any individuals presenting only with upper respiratory symptoms such as sore throat coryza or rhinorrhoea combinations of symptoms with other readily available information such as contact or travel history or the local recent case detection rate may prove more useful and should be further investigated in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms for covid19 is moderate to low and any testing strategy using symptoms as selection mechanism will result in both large numbers of missed cases and large numbers of people requiring testing which one of these is minimised is determined by the goal of covid19 testing strategies that is controlling the epidemic by isolating every possible case versus identifying those with clinically important disease so that they can be monitored or treated to optimise their prognosis the former will require a testing strategy that uses very few symptoms as entry criterion for testing the latter could focus on more specific symptoms such as fever and anosmia,PMC9121352,35593186,0.5532865524291992
validation of artificial intelligence to support the automatic coding of patient adverse drug reaction reports using nationwide pharmacovigilance data,introduction adverse drug reaction reports are usually manually assessed by pharmacovigilance experts to detect safety signals associated with drugs with the recent extension of reporting to patients and the emergence of mass mediarelated sanitary crises adverse drug reaction reports currently frequently overwhelm pharmacovigilance networks artificial intelligence could help support the work of pharmacovigilance experts during such crises by automatically coding reports allowing them to prioritise or accelerate their manual assessment after a previous study showing first results we developed and compared stateoftheart machine learning models using a larger nationwide dataset aiming to automatically precode patients adverse drug reaction reports objectives we aimed to determine the best artificial intelligence model identifying adverse drug reactions and assessing seriousness in patients reports from the french national pharmacovigilance web portal methods reports coded by 27 pharmacovigilance centres between march 2017 and december 2020 were selected n  11633 for each report the portable document format form containing freetext information filled by the patient and the corresponding encodings of adverse event symptoms in medical dictionary for regulatory activities preferred terms and seriousness were obtained this encoding by experts was used as the reference to train and evaluate models which contained input data processing and machinelearning natural language processing to learn and predict encodings we developed and compared different approaches for data processing and classifiers performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic area under the curve auc fmeasure sensitivity specificity and positive predictive value we used data from 26 pharmacovigilance centres for training and internal validation external validation was performed using data from the remaining pharmacovigilance centres during the same period results internal validation for adverse drug reaction identification term frequencyinverse document frequency tfidf  light gradient boosted machine lgbm achieved an auc of 097 and an fmeasure of 080 the crosslingual language model xlm transformer obtained an auc of 097 and an fmeasure of 078 for seriousness assessment fasttext  lgbm achieved an auc of 085 and an fmeasure of 063 camembert transformer  light gradient boosted machine obtained an auc of 084 and an fmeasure of 063 external validation for both adverse drug reaction identification and seriousness assessment tasks yielded consistent and robust results conclusions our artificial intelligence models showed promising performance to automatically code patient adverse drug reaction reports with very similar results across approaches our system has been deployed by national health authorities in france since january 2021 to facilitate pharmacovigilance of covid19 vaccines further studies will be needed to validate the performance of the tool in reallife settings,PMC9112264,35579816,0.5043526887893677

a new algorithmic approach for the extraction of temporal associations from clinical narratives with an application to medical product safety surveillance reports,the sheer volume of textual information that needs to be reviewed and analyzed in many clinical settings requires the automated retrieval of key clinical and temporal information the existing natural language processing systems are often challenged by the low quality of clinical texts and do not demonstrate the required performance in this study we focus on medical product safety report narratives and investigate the association of the clinical events with appropriate time information we developed a novel algorithm for tagging and extracting temporal information from the narratives and associating it with related events the proposed algorithm minimizes the performance dependency on text quality by relying only on shallow syntactic information and primitive properties of the extracted event and time entities we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by evaluating its tagging and time assignment capabilities on 140 randomly selected reports from the us vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers and the fda food and drug administration adverse event reporting system faers we compared the performance of our tagger with the sutime and heideltime taggers and our algorithms eventtime associations with the temporal awareness and reasoning systems for question interpretation tarsqi we further evaluated the ability of our algorithm to correctly identify the time information for the events in the 2012 informatics for integrating biology and the bedside i2b2 challenge corpus for the time tagging task our algorithm performed better than the sutime and the heideltime taggers fmeasure in vaers and faers our algorithm 086 and 088 sutime 077 and 074 and heideltime 075 and 042 respectively in the eventtime association task our algorithm assigned an inappropriate timestamp for 25 of the events while the tarsqi toolkit demonstrated a considerably lower performance assigning inappropriate timestamps in 615 of the same events our algorithm also supported the correct calculation of 69 of the event relations to the section time in the i2b2 testing set,,27327528,0.5558739304542542
interactome of the hepatitis c virus literature mining with andsystem,a study of the molecular genetics mechanisms of hostpathogen interactions is of paramount importance in developing drugs against viral diseases currently the literature contains a huge amount of information that describes interactions between hcv and human proteins in addition there are many factual databases that contain experimentally verified data on hcvhost interactions the sources of such data are the original data along with the data manually extracted from the literature however the manual analysis of scientific publications is time consuming and because of this databases created with such an approach often do not have complete information one of the most promising methods to provide actualisation and completeness of information is text mining here with the use of a previously developed method by the authors using andsystem an automated extraction of information on the interactions between hcv and human proteins was conducted as a data source for the text mining approach pubmed abstracts and full text articles were used additionally external factual databases were analyzed on the basis of this analysis a special version of andsystem extended with the hcv interactome was created the hcv interactome contains information about the interactions between 969 human and 11 hcv proteins among the 969 proteins 153 new proteins were found not previously referred to in any external databases of proteinprotein interactions for hcvhost interactions thus the extended andsystem possesses a more comprehensive detailing of hcvhost interactions versus other existing databases it was interesting that hcv proteins more preferably interact with human proteins that were already involved in a large number of proteinprotein interactions as well as those associated with many diseases among human proteins of the hcv interactome there were a large number of proteins regulated by micrornas it turned out that the results obtained for proteinprotein interactions and micrornaregulation did not depend on how well the proteins were studied while proteindisease interactions appeared to be dependent on the level of study in particular the mean number of diseases linked to wellstudied proteins proteins were considered wellstudied if they were mentioned in 50 or more pubmed publications from the hcv interactome was 208 significantly exceeding the mean number of associations with diseases 101 for the total set of wellstudied human proteins present in andsystem for proteins not highly poorlystudied investigated proteins from the hcv interactome each protein was referred to in less than 50 publications distribution of the number of diseases associated with them had no statistically significant differences from the distribution of the number of diseases associated with poorlystudied proteins based on the total set of human proteins stored in andsystem with this the average number of associations with diseases for the hcv interactome and the total set of human proteins were 03 and 02 respectively thus andsystem extended with the hcv interactome can be helpful in a wide range of issues related to analyzing hcvhost interactions in the search for antihcv drug targets the demo version of the extended andsystem covered here containing only interactions between human proteins genes metabolites diseases mirnas and moleculargenetic pathways as well as interactions between human proteinsgenes and hcv proteins is freely available at the following web address httpwwwbionetssccrupsdandhcv,,26673098,0.6595041751861572

accurate predictions of populationlevel changes in sequence and structural properties of hiv1 env using a volatilitycontrolled diffusion model,the envelope glycoproteins envs of hiv1 continuously evolve in the host by random mutations and recombination events the resulting diversity of env variants circulating in the population and their continuing diversification process limit the efficacy of aids vaccines we examined the historic changes in env sequence and structural features measured by integrity of epitopes on the env trimer in a geographically defined population in the united states as expected many env features were relatively conserved during the 1980s from this state some features diversified whereas others remained conserved across the years we sought to identify clues to predict the observed historic diversification patterns comparison of viruses that cocirculate in patients at any given time revealed that each feature of env sequence or structural exists at a defined level of variance the inhost variance of each feature is highly conserved among individuals but can vary between different hiv1 clades we designate this property volatility and apply it to model evolution of features as a linear diffusion process that progresses with increasing genetic distance volatilities of different features are highly correlated with their divergence in longitudinally monitored patients volatilities of features also correlate highly with their populationlevel diversification using volatility indices measured from a small number of patient samples we accurately predict the population diversity that developed for each feature over the course of 30 years amino acid variants that evolved at key antigenic sites are also predicted well therefore small fluctuations in feature values measured in isolated patient samples accurately describe their potential for populationlevel diversification these tools will likely contribute to the design of populationtargeted aids vaccines by effectively capturing the diversity of currently circulating strains and addressing properties of variants expected to appear in the future,PMC5383018,28384158,0.525663435459137

hybrid markov chain models of sir disease dynamics,deterministic epidemic models are attractive due to their compact nature allowing substantial complexity with computational efficiency this partly explains their dominance in epidemic modelling however the small numbers of infectious individuals at early and late stages of an epidemic in combination with the stochastic nature of transmission and recovery events are critically important to understanding disease dynamics this motivates the use of a stochastic model with continuoustime markov chains being a popular choice unfortunately even the simplest markovian sir modelthe socalled general stochastic epidemichas a state space of order formula see text where n is the number of individuals in the population and hence computational limits are quickly reached here we introduce a hybrid markov chain epidemic model which maintains the stochastic and discrete dynamics of the markov chain in regions of the state space where they are of most importance and uses an approximate modelnamely a deterministic or a diffusion modelin the remainder of the state space we discuss the evaluation efficiency and accuracy of this hybrid model when approximating the distribution of the duration of the epidemic and the distribution of the final size of the epidemic we demonstrate that the computational complexity is formula see text and that under suitable conditions our approximations are highly accurate,,28013336,0.5665714144706726

small distances can keep bacteria at bay for days,transmission of pathogens between spatially separated hosts ie indirect transmission is a commonly encountered phenomenon important for epidemic pathogen spread the routes of indirect transmission often remain untraced making it difficult to develop control strategies here we used a tailormade design to study indirect transmission experimentally using two different zoonotic bacteria in broilers previous experiments using a single bacterial species yielded a delay in the onset of transmission which we hypothesized to result from the interplay between diffusive motion of infectious material and decay of infectivity in the environment indeed a mathematical model of diffusive pathogen transfer predicts a delay in transmission that depends both on the distance between hosts and on the magnitude of the pathogen decay rate our experiments carried out with two bacterial species with very different decay rates in the environment confirm the difference in transmission delay predicted by the model these results imply that for control of an infectious agent the time between the distant exposure and the infection event is important to illustrate how this can work we analyzed data observed on the spread of vancomycinresistant enterococcus in an intensive care unit indeed a delayed vancomycinresistant enterococcus transmission component was identified in these data and this component disappeared in a study period in which the environment was thoroughly cleaned therefore we suggest that the impact of control strategies against indirect transmission can be assessed using our model by estimating the control measures effects on the diffusion coefficient and the pathogen decay rate,PMC3948290,24550476,0.5032490491867065

spatiotemporal dynamics of insect pest population under viral infection,the interrelationship between pathogen infection and host mobility is of great importance for successful spread of disease in spatial pest population as spread of infection depends on horizontal transmission of pathogen there are numerous factors like susceptibility latent period host movement that influence overall effectiveness of the control policy initiation of new infection cycle depends on density of infected inoculum in the site so spatial movement of infected hosts during the course of infection influence the dynamics also infected individuals are more vulnerable to predators and hence production of virus particles in the site depends on predation to some extent we derive a four dimensional delayed reactiondiffusion model in one spatial dimension and compute the minimum travelling speed of transmission of infection we show that the minimum speed is sensitive to several parameters of the system for example the minimum speed decreases only with increase in delay in lysis process but otherwise it increases with increase in force of infection diffusivity of infectives or per capita virus production a concluding discussion with numerical simulation is presented in the end,,23562890,0.5796650648117065
